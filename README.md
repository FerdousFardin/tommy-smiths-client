# Tommy Smiths Photography - A Photography Service

**Need a website, but don't have the time to build one yourself?**
This website is a React-based photo service that allows you to provide your service to fullest.

### Features Section

- ## ReactJS

This website exclusively uses React JS and in-house frameworks to build webpages. Created by Facebook, React JS is the go-to framework for building complex web applications.

- ## MongoDB

Tommy Smiths uses MongoDB to store all data in a NoSQL database. With noSQL databases, data is not restricted by rigid schemas and can be queried with ad hoc queries.

- ## Firebase

Tommy Smiths uses Firebase Authentication for all accounts, which offers easy integration with Google, Facebook, Twitter and others. So you never have to remember another password!

- ## React Router

  This website uses React-router to supply the browser with an asynchronous URL that corresponds to the data that will show on the web page. React-router allows the website to be used as a single-page-application since it retains the application's regular structure and functionality.

- ## JSON Web Token
  This website uses JSON Web Token or JWT to let a user sign in using their credentials. JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties with tokens because they can be signed while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties.
